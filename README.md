# hello-world
My first one ever!
I am Avinash Tadavarthy. I am pursuing my degree in Civil Engineering in the National Institute of Technology, Tiruchirappalli. I am also highly interested in the fields of Android Application Development, Marketing and Western Arts.

I am an explorer for opportunities and am always open to trying out things that are new to me.
